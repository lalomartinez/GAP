# GAP
Gene prediiction and functional Annotation Pipeline
GAP is a workflow who have as main aim the automatization of prediction and functional assignation of genes for microbial genomes.


GAP is divided into two modules. The first module for gene prediction module, using prodigal and the second module uses EggNOG 4.5 database to assign function by orhologs search using the EggNOG-mapper tool and Interproscan to detect homology based on domains.
